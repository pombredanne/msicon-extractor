About msicon-extractor
========================

msicon-extractor is able to extract icons from microsoft .ICO files and
PE files (.exe and .dll) and ouputs them in a freedesktop.org compliant
directory structure (so it can be directly used in an icon theme)

Highlights:
    * Support for both PE32 and PE32+ (64 bit exe)
    * Works on big and little endian systems
    * Small test suite to verify basic functionality

Dependencies:
    * autotools (for git build)
    * C99 compiler and standard library (tested with gcc)
    * glib 2.x (tested with >=2.32)
    * libpng (libpng1.2)

It should run on any Unix-like operating system and maybe even on Windows,
but it was only tested on linux.

Building:
    * download source code and run `./configure` or `autogen.sh`
        ./autogen.sh
    * run make
    * run test suite: `make check`

Installing:
    * `make install` should work fine

    * Code: GPLv3 (see LICENSE)
    * The test suite operates on some firefox binaries I happened to have lying
      around. There may be trademark issues involved.
